Node.js Express app with Bootstrap, enabling users to save their emotional data and analyze it.

To start:
run 'npm install' in root directory
run 'npm start' and navigate browser to localhost:3000/

Improvements:
- check if input is correct
- implement react on front-end (given the scale of this project this was unnecessary) and redux as state manager
